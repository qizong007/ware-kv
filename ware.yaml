  # The storage engine splits the TABLE into several shards.
  # For better performance, the WRITE is not just in time.
  # As you can see, there's a WriteQueue.
  Shard:
    Num: 16 # default is 16, it will always be 2^n for MOD in hash (nearest 2^n)
    WriteQueueCap: 256 # default is 256
    WriteTickInterval: 100 # default is 100 millisecond

  # For better performance, GC plays a role.
  GC:
    TaskCap: 1024 # default is 1024
    TickInterval: 500 # default is 500 millisecond

  # There's a SubscribeCenter to handle the pub/sub stuff.
  # I mean, this is not just in time, the first time callback and retry.
  Subscriber:
    DefaultCallbackMethod: "GET" # default is "GET", you can choose "POST"
    RetryQueueLen: 128 # default is 128
    RetryTickInterval: 1000 # default is 1000 millisecond

  # It means that, 'You get your machine info' is also not just in time!
  # It's a 'cache' for real, or 'snapshot'.
  MachineInfo:
    FreshFrequency: 1000 # default is 1000 millisecond

# It's a WAL.
Tracker:
  FilePath: ./tracker.log # relative to 'tracker' dir
  BufRefreshTickInterval: 1000 # default is 1000 millisecond, 0 is real-time mode
